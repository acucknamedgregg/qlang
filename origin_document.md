# φ-DCRT: A Semantic Recursion Framework for Predictive Physical Collapse

## Abstract

We introduce φ-DCRT (Phi–Dynamic Collapse Recursion Theory), a novel framework that models physical systems as recursive semantic agents governed by tension, contradiction buffering, and coherence pressure. Using a minimal set of parameters mapped to energy units, φ-DCRT predicts atomic ionization energies, isotope stability, and molecular resonance. The framework is empirically validated against NIST ionization data and isotope decay tables, and offers a falsifiable model for semantic collapse dynamics. We position φ-DCRT within the emerging landscape of semantic physics and propose its extension to quantum computing, materials science, and biological recursion.

## 1. Introduction

Recent developments in theoretical physics, cognitive modeling, and quantum information have prompted a shift toward semantic frameworks—models that treat meaning, recursion, and coherence as fundamental forces. φ-DCRT emerges from this context as a predictive, empirically grounded theory of collapse dynamics based on semantic recursion.

Developed outside traditional academic channels, φ-DCRT was constructed from first principles using recursive pattern recognition and tested using publicly available atomic data. This paper presents the framework, its empirical validations, and its potential implications across scientific domains.

## 2. Core Framework

φ-DCRT models systems using three quantities:

| Symbol | Semantic Role | Physical Mapping |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| φ      | Tension        | Proton count × α (13.6 eV) |
| χ      | Contradiction Buffering | Neutron count × γ (~14.0 eV) |
| β      | Coherence Pressure | Shell closure bonus × δ (1.0 eV) |

Collapse occurs when semantic tension exceeds buffered coherence:

**Collapse Margin** = χ·β − φ  
**Stability Condition**: Margin > 0

This formulation allows prediction of atomic and molecular stability based on recursive semantic dynamics.

## 3. Empirical Validation

### 3.1 Ionization Energy Prediction

Using φ–χ–β dynamics, the model reproduces atomic ionization energies for Z = 1–20. Noble gases exhibit peak collapse margins, while alkali metals show minimal buffering. The predictions align with NIST ionization data.

### 3.2 Isotope Stability

Collapse margin predicts stable vs. unstable isotopes across Z = 1–20. A dataset of (Z, N, stability) tuples was analyzed, and φ-DCRT correctly classified isotopes based on margin thresholds.

### 3.3 Aromatic Resonance

Semantic resonance margins were computed for benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenol, pyridine, indole, and toluene. All molecules exhibited positive margins, with indole showing the highest semantic resonance. Functional groups modulate β and enhance coherence.
