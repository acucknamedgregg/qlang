# φ-DCRT: Semantic Recursion Framework for Predictive Physical Collapse

**φ-DCRT (Phi–Dynamic Collapse Recursion Theory)** is a novel framework that models physical systems as recursive semantic agents governed by tension (φ), contradiction buffering (χ), and coherence pressure (β). It predicts atomic ionization energies, isotope stability, and molecular resonance using a falsifiable collapse margin:

**Collapse Margin** = χ·β − φ  
**Stability Condition**: Margin > 0

## Features

- Predicts ionization energies (Z = 1–20)
- Models isotope stability across neutron variations
- Quantifies aromatic resonance in organic molecules
- Offers a semantic lens on chemistry, quantum computing, and cognition
